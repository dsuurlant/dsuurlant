# About me

I grew up in a tiny village in the south of the Netherlands. I first learned about code when I was 8, copying BASIC from a paper manual onto my Commodore 64. Later on I would move from graphic design into PHP programming and have been a fan of the world's most used yet least popular web development language since. PHP is awesome!

My hobbies include gaming, D&D, writing, drawing, nail polish, and I have a second job as cat mom that is mostly paid in cuddles.
